There were no computer courses offered in my high school.  First time I took a computer course was in University (1984-1989).  There were a couple of courses, and I wrote a Fortran program as part of my 4th year project.  I enjoyed programming, found it logical and straightforward, a good way to make sure you are thinking through every step as you write a program (we did Basic, Fortran, and Pascal).  Hardest part was debugging.  But overall, quite enjoyable.  Used programming once on the job--wrote a small Qbasic program to extrapolate a data series.
